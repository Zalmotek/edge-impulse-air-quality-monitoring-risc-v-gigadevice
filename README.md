# Air Quality monitoring with Sipeed Longan Nano V1.1- RISC-V Gigadevice

## The challenge

Poor air quality in industrial environments can reduce productivity and raise the risk of accidents. That's why it's critical for industrial facilities to regularly evaluate air quality, guaranteeing that their staff is healthy and productive by doing so.

## The solution

We have developed a prototype that uses a Sipeed Longan Nano V1.1- RISC-V Gigadevice and gas sensors to detect trends in the variation of air quality dimensions by creating a Machine Learning model in Edge Impulse and deploying it on the device to trigger an alarm if they are headed towards a critical level. 

## Conclusion

By selecting the proper sensors for your use case and training the model accordingly, you may develop an accurate bespoke gas tracker.The Gigadevice processor is a powerhouse, and we believe it is underutilized in this application. However, given the price and capabilities of the development board, it is a good buy, with room to grow for other applications as RISC V processors gain popularity in industry, academia, and among hobbyists.
